# Objective:
Build a demo web application for a hypothetical travel company using the OpenAI Chat Completions API. This project should showcase a creative use of LLMs in building a real time experience. 

_**The twist, however, is to design a single page application without a traditional chat interface. What can you do to drive the user experience? Be creative!**_

# Requirements:
## Interface: 
Design a single-page application without a traditional chat interface

## OpenAI API Integration:
An integration of the Chat Completions API with streaming outputs. 

## User Experience:
A clean user interface, with a light branding of your choice. 
Technology: You can use any modern web framework. We recommend Next.js / React, but you’re welcome to use what you’re most comfortable with. 

# Guidelines:
## Focus: 
We recommend concentrating on the API integration and UI interaction, but you can be creative! Feel free to take shortcuts or mock functionality if you’re thinking of adding third-party integrations. 

## Time Commitment: 
Try to limit yourself to no more than 4 hours. This helps ensure you focus on key features to show the API’s capabilities, and please feel free to share what you would have done with more time. 

# Submission: 
Package your project as a .zip file containing all source code. Provide a README with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.

# Evaluation:
Your submission will be evaluated on code quality, presentation, and functionality. This project is intentionally open-ended to allow for creativity, but if you have any questions or need further clarification, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
